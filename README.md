 # appointmentPlanner-React
Use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

Work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks. The requirements section will walk through implementing the app from the topmost component down. You can implement it in a different order if you wish.
